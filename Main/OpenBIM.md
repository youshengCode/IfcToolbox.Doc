IfcToolbox is a **.Net** kit of simple tools for processing IFC files. It provides tools to optimize, convert, split, relocate and anonymize IFC files easily. Based on open-source libraries like [Xbim](https://docs.xbim.net/) and [IfcOpenShell](http://ifcopenshell.org/). 

IfcToolbox is one of the proposals in [openBIM Marketplace - buildingSMART Technical](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/misc/openbim-marketplace/). If you want to see IfcToolbox in this year's buildingSMART International Summit 2021, please [vote for IfcToolbox !](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/misc/openbim-marketplace/)

**IfcToolbox is a free software for support OpenBIM.**

Source code of tools is available in GitHub  https://github.com/youshengCode/IfcToolbox

[Download IFC Toolbox from Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ifc-toolbox/9n77phd2h471#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

## Tools in the box

- IFC Optimizer – Reduce the size of large IFC files by optimizing the IFC resource layer instance, and eliminate floating-point offsets through FPR geometric optimization.
- IFC Converter – Easily convert IFC to OBJ(.obj), Collada(.dae), STEP(.stp), IGES(.igs), XML(.xml) and SVG(.svg).
- IFC Splitter – Split IFC files by type/container (site, building, level) or simply split selected objects in the hierarchy.
- IFC Relocator – Relocate the IFC world coordinate system and the project coordinate system. Align the origin of the two models.
- IFC Anonymizer – Anonymous user-related information and specific product-related information. Simplify model submission in bidding activities or design competitions.

## GUI App in Microsoft Store 

There is also a GUI version desktop app, which contains all the implementations of these tools. The IfcToolbox App is **designed for No-Code users and to provide a better user experience.**
