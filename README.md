## Free and Open

IfcToolbox is a .Net kit of simple tools for processing IFC files. It provides tools to optimize, convert, split, relocate and anonymize IFC files easily. Based on open-source libraries like [Xbim](https://docs.xbim.net/) and [IfcOpenShell](http://ifcopenshell.org/). 

IfcToolbox is one of the proposals in [openBIM Marketplace - buildingSMART Technical](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/misc/openbim-marketplace/). 

Thank you all for ❤️ IFC Toolbox!

## Tools in the box

- IFC Optimizer – Reduce the size of large IFC files by optimizing the IFC resource layer instance, and eliminate floating-point offsets through FPR geometric optimization.
- IFC Converter – Easily convert IFC to OBJ(.obj), Collada(.dae), STEP(.stp), IGES(.igs), XML(.xml) and SVG(.svg).
- IFC Splitter – Split IFC files by type/container (site, building, level) or simply split selected objects in the hierarchy.
- IFC Relocator – Relocate the IFC world coordinate system and the project coordinate system. Align the origin of the two models.
- IFC Anonymizer – Anonymous user-related information and specific product-related information. Simplify model submission in bidding activities or design competitions.
